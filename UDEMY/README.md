In these UDEMY online data science and machine learning courses, I have completed all of the courses, exercises and capstone projects. From the courses, I have gain

#### 1.Data Analysis:
Numpy: Numerical computing with arrays and matrices.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis, handling data frames.

#### 2. Data Visualization:
Matplotlib: Creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative graphics.

#### 3. Machine Learning:
Scikit-learn: Implementing machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
Supervised Learning: Techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Unsupervised Learning: Techniques such as clustering (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering), dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
