In this <b>UDEMY</b> online <b>data science and machine learning Bootcamp</b>, I have completed all of the courses, exercises and capstone projects. From the courses, I have gain

#### 1.Data Analysis:
- <b>Numpy</b>: Numerical computing with arrays and matrices.
- <b>Pandas</b>: Data manipulation and analysis, handling data frames.

#### 2. Data Visualization:
- <b>Matplotlib</b>: Creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- <b>Seaborn</b>: Statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative graphics.

#### 3. Machine Learning:
<b>Scikit-learn</b>: Implementing machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
- <b>Supervised Learning</b>: Techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- <b>Unsupervised Learning</b>: Techniques such as clustering (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering), dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
